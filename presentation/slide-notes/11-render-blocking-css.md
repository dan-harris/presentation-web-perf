### render blocking

- so from the previous slide about how the brrowser first loads
- can see that CSS / DOM / JS blocks our ability to progress the render
- DOM... well thats kinda sorted
- look at CSS -> often overlooked
- yuge css bundles
- understand some tradeoffs that frameworks may be making
- again just opinions
