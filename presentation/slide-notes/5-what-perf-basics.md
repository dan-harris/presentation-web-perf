### what perf?

- with previous context in mind
- what are we actually looking at today?
- well a couple of things, that might seem simple...
- but, if you can get them right, are pretty awesome
- also, if you can bake in to projects early, can give some great boosts
- no need to boil the perf oceans
- twitter thought leaders .etc

### first load

- getting our content to users
- that seamless first experience

### smooth animations

- animations add that pizzazz
- get them smooth
- need to be performant
