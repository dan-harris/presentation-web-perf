### Not an attempt to be 'smarter-art-thou'

- gauge level we're all at
- somewhat tailor some of my next slides
- just interested anyway 🤷‍♀️

### Confidence with Web

- e.g. building some HTML/templates + CSS
- loading assets .etc

### Confidence with JS

- browser event loop?
- JS tasks .etc
