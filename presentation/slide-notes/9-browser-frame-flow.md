### every time you change something

- how do we rejig everything to display again?
- essentially 'render' a 'frame'

### js event loop + object models

- similar to before
- execute any js in the event loop
- build up css + html + js
- CSS / DOM + JS
- can't render untill all three
- have to have all

### create a tree with styles .etc

- this is where the accisibility treee is built from

### layout

- figure out where things go in relation to page / each other

### paint

- actually paint things on page

### extra step around paint
